# watch

This is a frontend project where I created a simple video platform using a JavaScript library React to build the UI. The project is called [watch](https://watch-video-app.netlify.app/) and it displays a gallery of videos, allows to search for videos as well as play them. It also allows the user to toggle between light and dark mode. It makes use of a promise-based HTTP client Axios to interact with the YouTube Data API and is deployed on Netlify.
These are some of the tools and technologies employed in the project:

- React with Context API
- React-router-dom
- Axios
- YouTube Data API
- Semantic UI and CSS

Used React Hooks: useEffect, useState, useContext, useHistory

The Watch project is inspired by and based on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
