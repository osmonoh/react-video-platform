# WATCH - React project

This is a frontend project where I created a simple video platform using a JavaScript library React to build the UI. The project is called Watch and it displays a gallery of videos, allows to search for videos as well as play them. It makes use of a promise-based HTTP client Axios to interact with the YouTube Data API.

These are some of the tools and technologies employed in the project:

- React with Context API
- React-router-dom
- Axios
- YouTube Data API
- Semantic UI and CSS

Used React Hooks:

- useEffect
- useState
- useContext
- useHistory
- useCallback

The Watch project is inspired by and based on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
